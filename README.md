# neovim-config

This repo contains the configuration and plugins that I have developed over the few months of using the editor so far.

View **init.vim** for an overview of what's been modified.

**Note**
 - I only use this on unix based systems (linux/macOs), so I do not know how this would work on a Windows machine.
 - Files should reside within *~/.config/nvim/* to work properly
