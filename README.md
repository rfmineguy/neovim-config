# neovim-config

This repo contains the configuration and plugins that I have developed over the few months of using the editor so far.

View **init.vim** for an overview of what's been modified.

**Note**
 - I only use this on unix based systems (linux/macOs), so I do not know how this would work on a Windows machine.

*The following assumes neovim is installed and in your path*
**Setup Guide**
 1. clone repository into **~/.config/nvim/**
 2. open **~/.config/nvim/init/init.vim** and run :PlugInstall
 3. for youcompleteme to function properly for whatever language you use go to https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe
